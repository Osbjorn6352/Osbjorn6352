## Hello there! 

My name is Benjamin Osborn, a young professional programmer with a couple years of experience. I started my programming journey through the Unity Junior Programmer pathway and have come a long way since! I am nearing completion of a MS in Software Engineering with a focus in Real Time Game Systems from DePaul University. I currently work as an entry software engineer at DRW, a trading firm out of Chicago. 

### School Projects
In my time in school, I've worked on several noteworthy projects. 
I'm including links to my presentations of them rather than commiting the code directly to maintain the integrity of the courses involved for future students!
